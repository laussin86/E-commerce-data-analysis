# E-commerce-data-analysis
 **SUMMARY**
 
 My analysis has been divided in 3 part: Sales Analysis, Customers Analysis and Predictive Analysis. The Goal of those analysis is to find people who buy the most and the less, what they are buying. Also what is the most selling product and finally predict future sales using SARIMAX statistic model. Note that all the data required for each analysis has been done by using SQL queries to extract the required data.

 1- **Sales Analysis**

 The first analysis was to find was the most prefered method of payment:

As per the graph, We can see that the prefer payment type is card. Also, We can see most of the product has price between 12 and 28 and most transaction have a value between 5 and 100:
