 **SUMMARY**
 
 My analysis has been divided in 3 part: Sales Analysis, Customers Analysis and Predictive Analysis. The Goal of those analysis is to find people who buy the most and the less, what they are buying. Also what is the most selling product and finally predict future sales using SARIMAX statistic model. Note that all the data required for each analysis has been done by using SQL queries to extract the required data.
